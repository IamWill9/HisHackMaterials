        <h2>WPA2 Security assessment 12/04/2024 </h2>
        <p>The assessment investigates how secure our home wireless networks really are under the prevailing WPA2 protocol, analyzing routers provided by major UK ISPs like Sky, BT, and Virgin. The findings highlight both strengths and critical weaknesses, with a significant focus on the practical implications of these vulnerabilities.</p>

        <h2>Understanding the Threats</h2>
        <p>The study revealed that while obtaining hashed passwords from WPA2 authentication handshakes is relatively straightforward, cracking these hashes remains a formidable challenge unless the password complexity is low. This emphasizes the importance of strong, complex passwords to safeguard against unauthorized access.</p>

        <h2>Methodology and Tools</h2>
        <p>Employing the Cyber Kill Chain framework, the project explored various stages of a potential attack, from reconnaissance to weaponization and exploitation. Tools such as Kismet, Aircrack-ng, and Pwnagotchi were instrumental in demonstrating the ease of intercepting data and the potential to crack encrypted communications under certain conditions.</p>

        <h2>Key Recommendations</h2>
        <p>To mitigate the risks identified, several strategies were proposed. Among these, upgrading to WPA3 wherever possible stands out as a crucial step forward, alongside enhancing password policies and educating users about network security fundamentals.</p>

        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p>This analysis serves as a stark reminder of the continuous need for advancements in cybersecurity measures. It calls for proactive behavior from both ISPs and users, suggesting a shift towards more robust protocols and more informed network management practices.</p>
