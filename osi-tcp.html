        <h1>OSI/TCP Model</h1>
        <p>Understanding the OSI and TCP/IP models is essential for comprehending how different network protocols interact and function within cyber security frameworks. These models are crucial for diagnosing and resolving network issues effectively.</p>

        <h2>OSI Model Overview</h2>
        <p>The Open Systems Interconnection (OSI) model is a conceptual framework used to understand network interactions in seven layers. Each layer serves a specific function and communicates with the layers directly above and below it. The OSI Model includes:</p>
        <p>
            Physical Layer (Layer 1): Deals with the physical hardware of networking, including cables, switches, and more. Issues at this layer affect connectivity and are often physical (e.g., cable disconnections).<br>
            Data Link Layer (Layer 2): Handles communication between adjacent network nodes and can identify and possibly correct errors that may occur in the Physical layer.<br>
            Network Layer (Layer 3): Manages device addressing, tracks the location of devices on the network, and determines the best way to move data.<br>
            Transport Layer (Layer 4): Transfers data between systems and provides acknowledgment of successful transmissions.<br>
            Session Layer (Layer 5): Controls the connections between computers. It establishes, manages, and terminates the connections.<br>
            Presentation Layer (Layer 6): Transforms data to provide a standard interface for the Application layer.<br>
            Application Layer (Layer 7): Closest to the end user. Network processes that involve interaction with the user are facilitated here.

    <section class="tcp-ip-intro">
        <h2>TCP/IP Model Overview</h2>
        <p>The TCP/IP model is a more streamlined version of the OSI model, often used in real-world networking. It consists of four layers: Network Interface, Internet, Transport, and Application. Each layer in TCP/IP corresponds closely to one or more layers of the OSI model and is essential in troubleshooting various network issues.</p>
